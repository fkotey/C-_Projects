# [Simple Stock Analyzer in C++]()

A simple C++ application which read historical closed prices for MSFT, COST, and AMZN, compute the mean return and standard deviation and plot the time series of the prices and return using RInside.
  

### Running the App locally

To run the application locally, you will have to confugre eclipse to work with RCpp in R

I will be posting a link to a toturial on how to set up RCpp and Eclipse in Windows 10.
